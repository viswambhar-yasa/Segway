# Segway
A Segway PT - short for Segway Personal Transporter - is a two-wheeled, self-balancing personal transporter. We simulate a simplified Segway model of inverse pendulum on a moving platform.

We obtain a system of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations of
second order.
- ordinary differential equation - equation contains an entity u and its ordinary
derivatives 
- nonlinear - equation contains nonlinear expressions e.g. u^2, sin(u)
- second order - highest occuring derivative
- system - more than one equation
- coupled - equation regarding du^2 contains entities, that are not u or one of its derivatives

The ODE equation are solved using RK-4 Method.

The C++ code, upon execution, generates an output that is evaluated using the python script 'plot.py' that has already been provided. The output of this python script is a plot of entities over time. 

Code submitted to Technische Universit√§t Bergakademie Freiberg as a part of the Programming Project in the course Introduction to Scientific Programming in Wintersemester 2019/20 as stipulated by the curriculum of Masters Course Computational Materials Science.
